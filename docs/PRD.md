# Product Requirements Document (PRD): AI-Powered Multi-Agent Website/App Builder

## Project Overview

### Project Name: ai_collab_builder

### Original Requirements
Build a zero-cost, AI-powered "multi-agent" website/app builder with these features:

1. **User Input:** A web page where the user types a project description (e.g. "Create a React + Firebase chat app with login and admin dashboard") and clicks "Start."
2. **Agents & Roles:**
   * Emma (Product Manager) → generate `docs/PRD.md` (feature list, user stories, acceptance criteria).
   * Bob (Architect) → produce `docs/Architecture.md` (tech stack, folder structure, free-tier cloud setup).
   * Alex (Engineer) → create skeleton code files (`public/index.html`, `src/App.jsx`, `src/firebaseConfig.js`, etc.).
   * David (Data Analyst) → draft a Firestore data model and security rules (`src/utils/firestoreRules.js`) and an optional analytics component.
   * Mike (Team Leader) → review all outputs and write `README.md` (how to install and run locally).
3. **Output Format:** Each agent must return valid JSON containing `new_files` (array of `{ "path": "...", "content": "..." }`), optional `edits`, and a short `remarks` string.
4. **File Store & Versioning:** Use an in-memory or file-based JSON store (no paid databases). After each agent finishes, auto-snapshot the entire file tree as a timestamped JSON file. Provide a "Versions" list in the UI to restore any snapshot.
5. **Real-Time Collaboration:** Implement WebSocket (e.g., Socket.IO) so that when an agent writes or updates a file, connected clients instantly see the change in the file tree and editor.
6. **Front-End UI:**
   * Top "Team Bar" showing five avatars (Emma/PM, Bob/Architect, Alex/Engineer, David/Data Analyst, Mike/Team Leader) with a highlight for the active agent.
   * A prompt input box and "Start" button.
   * Left sidebar: collapsible file explorer (including a "Global Resources" folder of reusable boilerplate).
   * Center panel: open-source code editor (Monaco or CodeMirror, dark theme). Clicking a file loads its contents; users can manually edit and save.
   * Bottom console: scrollable log of agent actions (e.g., "Emma generated docs/PRD.md").
   * Footer: "Versions" button opening a modal with snapshot timestamps and "Restore" options.
7. **Back-End API:**
   * **`POST /api/start`**: `{ "userPrompt": "…" }` → returns `{ "projectId": "…" }` and triggers Emma.
   * **`POST /api/:projectId/agent/:agentName`**: Runs the specified agent with required context (e.g., PRD or Architecture). Parses its JSON, writes files, broadcasts WebSocket events.
   * **`GET /api/:projectId/files`**: Lists all file paths.
   * **`GET /api/:projectId/file?path=…`**: Returns `{ "content": "…" }`.
   * **`POST /api/:projectId/file`**: `{ "path": "...", "content": "...", "agent": "User" }` → saves a user edit and emits a WebSocket "fileUpdated" event.
   * **`GET /api/:projectId/versions`** & **`POST /api/:projectId/restore`**: Manage version snapshots stored as JSON.
8. **Free-Only Stack:** Use Node.js + Express + Socket.IO for the backend; React + Monaco/CodeMirror + Socket.IO client for the frontend; store snapshots as local JSON files (or SQLite/lowdb if needed); use OpenAI's free-tier GPT-3.5-turbo for all agent calls. No paid hosting—run locally or on free services (e.g., Vercel/Heroku free tiers).

## 1. Product Definition

### 1.1 Product Goals

1. **Maximize Developer Productivity**: Automate repetitive aspects of software project bootstrapping through multi-agent AI collaboration, allowing developers to focus on implementation details rather than boilerplate code creation.

2. **Democratize Application Development**: Lower the barrier to entry for creating well-structured software projects by providing AI-generated architecture, code scaffolding, and documentation that follows best practices.

3. **Foster Collaborative Development**: Create a real-time multi-user environment where teams can simultaneously contribute to and visualize the evolution of a software project from initial requirements to implementation.

### 1.2 User Stories

1. **As a solo developer**, I want to quickly scaffold a new project based on a simple text description, so that I can focus on implementing unique functionality rather than setting up boilerplate code and project structure.

2. **As a technical team lead**, I want to generate well-structured starter code and documentation for my team, so that we have a consistent foundation to build upon and clear architecture guidelines to follow.

3. **As a developer learning a new tech stack**, I want to generate a working example project with proper structure and documentation, so that I can understand best practices and architectural patterns.

4. **As a product manager**, I want to quickly prototype an application concept with minimal technical knowledge, so that I can validate ideas before committing engineering resources.

5. **As a development team**, we want to collaborate on a project in real-time with AI assistance, so that we can iterate quickly and maintain a shared understanding of the evolving codebase.

## 6. Open Questions

1. **Agent Fallback Mechanism**: How should the system handle cases where an agent fails to produce valid output or encounters an error?

2. **Expansion Beyond Web Applications**: Could the system be extended to support mobile app development, backend services, or other project types?

3. **LLM Selection Strategy**: Should users be able to select different LLM models for different agents, or should we standardize on GPT-3.5-turbo?

4. **Handling Large Projects**: What are the limitations on project size and complexity that can be effectively generated?

5. **User Customization of Agent Behavior**: To what extent should users be able to customize the behavior and outputs of individual agents?

6. **Integration with Existing Codebases**: Could the system be adapted to extend or modify existing projects rather than only creating new ones?

7. **Data Privacy Considerations**: How should we handle potentially sensitive information in user prompts or generated code?

## 7. Acceptance Criteria

1. **Multi-Agent System**
   - All five agents function correctly in sequence
   - Each agent produces the expected output format
   - Context is properly passed between agents
