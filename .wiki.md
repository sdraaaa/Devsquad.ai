# Project Summary
The Multi-Agent Application Builder project aims to provide a platform for creating and managing multi-agent applications. It focuses on enhancing collaboration among agents while streamlining the development process through a user-friendly interface. The project integrates various functionalities, allowing users to manage project versions, collaborate in real-time, and utilize AI-driven features to optimize agent performance.

# Project Module Description
- **Frontend**: Built using React, providing a dynamic user interface for interacting with the application.
- **Backend**: Node.js server that handles API requests, manages data, and connects to the frontend.
- **Version Control**: Allows users to manage different versions of projects effectively.
- **Agent Management**: Features for creating and managing agents, including their interactions and settings.
